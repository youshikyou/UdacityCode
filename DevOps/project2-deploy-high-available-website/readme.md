# Introduction
Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram. Developers pushed the latest version of their code in a zip file located in a public S3 Bucket.
You have been tasked with deploying the application, along with the necessary supporting software into its matching infrastructure.
This needs to be done in an automated fashion so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.

## Requirements:

### Server specs
- Deploy a wep application using infractructure as a code including a launch configuration that will be used by an auto scaling group.
### Security groups and IAM Role
The servers will run inside a security group and the file that will be used for the project have to download from udacity s3 bucket. An IAM role will be use to allow s3 bucket to our instances
