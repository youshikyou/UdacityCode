TASK 1:
How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?
Print a message:
"There are <count> different telephone numbers in the records."
"""

'''
All telephone numbers are 10 numerical digits long.
Each telephone number starts with a code indicating the location and/or type of the telephone number.
There are three different kinds of telephone numbers, each with a different format:

1.Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets.
The area codes vary in length but always begin with 0. Example: (022)40840621.

2.Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle of the number to help readability.
The mobile code of a mobile number is its first four digits and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
Example: 93412 66159.

3.Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but start with the code 140. Example: 1402316533.
