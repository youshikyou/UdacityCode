Use linklist because the requirement from problem.



n is the number of items in list1, m is the number of items in list2

Union
Time complexity:
    O(n+m)

Space complexity:
    appeared_map ={} for tracking which item appeared before.
    O(n+m)



Intersection
Time complexity:
    O(n+m)

Space complexity:
    appeared_map ={} for tracking which item appeared before.
    O(n+m)
